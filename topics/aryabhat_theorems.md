Space, as defined by the Oxford English dictionary, is the dimensions of height, depth, and width within which all things exist and move. It is almost a vacuum, containing almost nothing. The {{ page.book }} describes such nothingness poetically:

We know from observations that space is filled with objects that are, primarily, spherical in nature and are hot dense masses of solids, liquids, and gas, and that these spherical masses might have sentient life forms living on them.

One such mass is known as Earth and is populated, inter alia, by human beings. One such human being, who lived a very long time ago, was known as Aryabhat. He was a mathematician and an astronomer.  Here are some of his theorems:

-  Theorem 1: Lorem ipsum man kyon behka re behka aadhi. Raat ko, bela mehka re mehka.
-  Theorem 2: Barbara celarent darii ferio barbari. Cesaro cesare Camestres, festino baroco, celaront camestrop. Darapti disamis datisi felapton.
-  Theorem 3: Sedin dujone dulechhinu bone, phulodore bandha jhulona.
