# Time and distance

Time is the distance between the occurrence of two events. Distance is the length of space between two objects or events. Time can be measured in kilometers ("How long is it to Babylon? Six hundred and thirty kilometers.") and distance can be measured in years ("How far is it to Eden? A lifetime, and then some.")

According to a theorem in Physics, the quotient of distance and time is equal to the speed of an object. Thus, if the distance to Eden is 340 light years and the time it takes an object called Aryabhat to get to Eden is 20 years, the speed of Aryabhat is 17 light years per year. Assuming that Eden is northwards from Aryabhat’s starting position (assume that it’s Ujjain), Aryabhat’s velocity is 17 light years per year north.

Now, assume that Aryabhat, travelling to Eden with that velocity, has a mass of 25 stones. Then, the momentum of Aryabhat, which is a product of mass and velocity, is 425 stone-lightyears per year.

A long time ago, in the distant past, there was a scientist called Hiesenberg who postulated that, for a given pair of momentum and position, the value of only one pair can be known with any degree of certainty at any point of time. So, for Aryabhat, for any specific time,
-  If you know, for certain, that Aryabhat is in Ujjain (or any other point between Ujjain and Eden), you cannot know with any degree of certainty what Aryabhat’s momentum is
-  If you know, for certain, that Aryabhat’s momentum is 425, you cannot know with any degree of certainty where exactly Aryabhat is

Which brings us to the theory of relativity, which says, that the time of occurrence of the same event (for example, the sighting of Aryabhat on the path to Eden) happens at different times for people at different positions. So it happens that an object in space, such as the sun, burns up stuff and creates light at X point in time, and that same event of light creation is seen by me on earth at X+8 minutes.

Which, essentially, means that time and space cannot be separate from each other; time is space, space is time.
